## Pokemon Graphql using vue-apollo designed with Vuetify

Make sure to check the Pokemon and Dashboard for the full demonstration

It is an infinite scroll. Scroll the Pokemon tab to the end and see it fetch more data like Instagram

The data for Dashboard is static data coppied from internet

You can change the theme between dark and light from NavBar

In addition, click on each Pokemon card for more details about them

Update: Day "I can't remember" in quarantine. I wrote a backend for this one too. I even wrote something in Angular.

Might do something crazy later on, maybe backend with Java or C++ !!!
